🔒 Security Implementation
   Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials
2. Server validates credentials
3. Server generates JWT token
4. Client stores token for subsequent requests
5. Token is validated on each secured endpoint

   Security Measures
- Password encryption with BCrypt
- JWT token authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- HTTPS enforcement (in production)

 💳 Payment Integration
  Razorpay Integration
The platform supports Razorpay for payment processing. The implementation includes:
- Creating payment orders
- Handling payment verification
- Managing refunds

 Stripe Integration
Stripe payment processing includes:
- Creating payment intents
- Handling payment confirmations
- Subscription management
- Refund processing

 🌐 Deployment
  Production Considerations
- Set appropriate JVM memory settings
- Configure connection pooling
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
- Configure proper logging
- Set up database backups
